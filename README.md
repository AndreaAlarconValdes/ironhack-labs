# IRONHACK LABS - Programming Exercises 

This repository contains a collection of programming exercises I completed during my time at Ironhack bootcamp. It is currently **a work in progress**, as I am gathering all the exercises I have done over time. The repository is organized into folders based on the topic or programming language used.


## ðŸ“š Contents

- **Folder 1:** Practice with advanced JavaScript methods such as `map`, `reduce`, `filter`, and `sort` for array manipulation.  

Each folder contains source code files and sometimes instructions or comments to help understand the exercises.

## ðŸ”§ How to Use This Repository

### 1. Clone the repository:

```js
git clone https://github.com/AndreaAlarconValdes/ironhack-labs.git
```

### 2. Move to the folder of your choice:

```

### 3. Read the README file where you will find instructions to get started with the exercises.
